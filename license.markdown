<ul class="lcars-list">
    <li class="bullet-butterscotch"> Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.<br />
      Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
        <ul class="lcars-list">
            <li class="bullet-sunflower">Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.</li>
            <li class="bullet-sunflower">Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.</li>
            <li class="bullet-sunflower">Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li class="bullet-butterscotch"> If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
    share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
    creator(s) a pint.</li>
     
    <li class="bullet-butterscotch">Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
    you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html" target="_blank">bug report</a>.</li>

    <li class="bullet-butterscotch">If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository" target="_blank">How to cite a repo</a>. Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.</li>
</ul>
