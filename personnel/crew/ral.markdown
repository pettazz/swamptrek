talents:
  - name: Joined
    detail: >
      You are bonded with a symbiont and have lifetimes of memories to draw upon. You gain an additional character trait, which is the name of the symbiont; this reflects potential advantages of being Joined, as well as the ability to perform rites and rituals to awaken past hostsâ€™ memories, and the vulnerabilities inherent in the connection. Furthermore, up to twice per adventure, you may declare that a past Host had experience or expertise in a particular field: you gain an additional focus when you do this, which remains for the rest of the adventure.
  - name: Collaboration (Command)
    detail: >
      Choose a single department when you select this talent. Whenever an ally attempts a task using that department, you may spend 1 Momentum (Immediate) to allow them to use your rating for that department and one of your relevant focuses.

  - name: Advisor
