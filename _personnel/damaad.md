Veda Damaad is a tall and imposing Orion woman who has served as the representative of several wealthy mining interests on Cressida for three years, making her well-connected across the sector. She is demanding, arrogant, and straight to the point. In a crisis situation, she's level-headed and helpful, but she places no value on the lives of the native population. 

She sent the distress call that initiated the evacuation of Cressida and helped organize the process. Near the end, she requested that the *Hanesawa* provide her with dedicated access to a transporter, for reasons she would not divulge. She waved away Urotoxa's requests to arm the indigenous Kizomans against the attacking creatures from the trimetric rift and offered a very useful favor if the crew acceeded to her request, which they did not.
