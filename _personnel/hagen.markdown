      You reduce the opportunity cost of engineering teams by 1, to a minimum of 0. Further, when you attempt a task to perform repairs to a starship or attempt to push the ship’s capabilities beyond its normal limits, you may spend 1 Momentum (Immediate) to re-roll a d20.
  - name: Operations Manager 
    detail: >
      Whenever you create a trait representing a piece of equipment, or an alteration made to existing equipment, any character who benefits from that trait while you are present in the scene may re-roll a d20.
species: 
  name: Betazoid
  ability:
    name: Telepathy
    detail: >
      You can sense the surface thoughts and emotions of most living beings nearby, and can communicate tele- pathically with other empaths and telepaths, as well as those with whom you are extremely familiar. You cannot choose not to sense the emotions or read the surface thoughts of those nearby, except for those resistant to telepathy. It requires effort and a task to pick out the emotions or thoughts of a specific individual in a crowd, to search a creature’s mind for specific thoughts or memories, or to block out the minds of those nearby. Increase the Difficulty if the situation is stressful, if there are many beings present, if the target target is resistant to telepathy, etc.

talents:
  - name: Psychokinesis
    detail: >
      You can manipulate and control objects using only the power of the mind. You may exert a psychic force upon an object within Close range equivalent to the force that you would normally be able to exert physically, though this takes concentration and cannot be done violently. You may spend 1 Momentum (Immediate, Repeatable) to increase the magnitude of the force you apply, with each Momentum spent counting as an additional person’s worth of force applied (that is, you can move or manipulate objects that would take two people to move or manipulate by spending 1 Momentum). Momentum (Immediate) may also be spent to increase the range of this: 1 Momentum to affect objects in Medium range, 2 Momentum to affect objects at Long range, and gamemaster’s discretion for distances beyond. To apply force violently instead, add 1 Threat to make a Control + Security task with a Difficulty of 2 to strike an opponent (as a Ranged Attack), inflicting a Stun or Deadly Injury with a Severity of 3.
  - name: Maintenance Specialist
    detail: >
      You may ignore the first complication rolled on any Engineering task. Further, when you create any equipment trait, any character who uses that piece of equipment in a task may ignore the first complication rolled.
  - name: Dauntless
    detail: >
      Whenever another character attempts to intimidate or threaten you, you may suffer 2 Stress to ignore their attempt.
  - name: Jury-Rig
    detail: >
      Whenever you attempt an Engineering task to perform repairs, you may reduce the Difficulty by 2, to a minimum of 0. If you do this, however, then the repairs are only temporary and will last only a single scene before they fail again; you may increase this duration by one scene by spending 1 Momentum (Repeatable). Jury-rigged repairs can only be applied once, and the Difficulty to repair a device that has been Jury-rigged increases by 1.
