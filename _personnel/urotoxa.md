An aging and distinguished Nausicaan woman, Urotoxa leads an archaeological expedition that has been studying the native Kizomic people and their technology. Holding the Nausicaan equivalent of advanced degrees in ancient technology, palynology, and computer sciences, Urotoxa is a shrewd thinker and an opportunistic strategist. She has spoken passionately in lectures across the sector, and she has used her oratorical skills to gather funding for numerous expeditions in the name of scientific advancement. 

During the evacuation of Cressida, she pleaded with Captain Ral and the crew of the *Hanesawa* to deliver weapons to the native Kizomans to use in defending themselves against the attacking trimetric rift creatures. The Captain declined, citing the Prime Directive. Lt. Ania Hagen discovered that she truly wanted to help the Kizomans but she also did not want the crew to visit the planet and discover something she was hiding.
